const questions = [
  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  // OPENER
  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  { cat: "Opener", q: "So what are you working on?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "We're building the data and execution infrastructure for prediction markets. We aggregate real-time and historical data from Kalshi, Polymarket, and others, pair it with real-world source data like weather forecasts, sports stats, and F1 telemetry, and give traders everything they need to build models, backtest, and execute. We trade on it ourselves to prove it works." },

  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  // PRODUCT & VISION
  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  { cat: "Product & Vision", q: "Can you explain the product in simple terms?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Imagine you want to trade prediction markets programmatically. Today you'd need to integrate with each exchange separately, scrape data, find external data sources, build backtesting, write execution logic. That takes months. With Attena, you pip install our SDK, pull unified data across all exchanges paired with source data, backtest your model, and go live with one API call. We handle everything underneath." },
  { cat: "Product & Vision", q: "What's the long-term vision?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "We want to be the default infrastructure layer for prediction markets, like Bloomberg is for traditional finance. Data, analytics, execution, all in one stack. As prediction markets grow from $10B to $1T+ in volume, we want to be the picks and shovels everyone builds on. Long term, we become a matching engine ourselves, internalizing order flow from our users before routing to exchanges." },
  { cat: "Product & Vision", q: "Why prediction markets specifically?", speaker: "Vojta", hint: "Prediction markets are where crypto was in 2017. Growing 10x year over year, no infrastructure exists, and the pricing is wildly inefficient because there are no quant tools. Every binary outcome in the world will eventually be tradable — weather, sports, elections, earnings, insurance. We're building the infrastructure before the flood." },
  { cat: "Product & Vision", q: "How is this different from just an API wrapper?", speaker: "Rob", hint: "pmxt, an open source project with 700 stars, is just an API wrapper. That's plumbing. We do three things they can't: one, we pair market data with real-world source data per vertical — the right weather station with the right Kalshi contract. Two, we have months of historical data including limit order book snapshots nobody else has. Three, we offer backtesting and execution, not just data. The full stack from idea to live trading." },
  { cat: "Product & Vision", q: "What's the crypto angle? Why Alliance?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Half of prediction market volume runs onchain through Polymarket. Our team spent 4 years at Marinade Finance on Solana, so we understand onchain infrastructure deeply. Alliance's network in crypto and DeFi is exactly what we need — prediction markets sit at the intersection of crypto, finance, and real-world data. Plus the token side letter opens up interesting protocol economics down the road." },
  { cat: "Product & Vision", q: "What do you mean by 'pairing source data'?", speaker: "Vojta", hint: "Take weather markets on Kalshi. The price says 60% chance Chicago goes above 50 degrees tomorrow. We pair that with the actual NWS forecast, historical accuracy of that forecast, ASOS station observations, and model ensemble disagreements. Now you can see: the forecast says 80% chance, the market says 60%. That gap is the edge. We do this for every vertical — ESPN stats for sports, lap times for F1, FRED data for economics." },
  { cat: "Product & Vision", q: "Why not just build a trading firm?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Honestly, that's where we started. We applied to YC pitching prop trading. They told us the infrastructure was the bigger business. And they were right — not because they told us, but because we saw it ourselves while building. A trading firm's revenue is capped by capital and strategy capacity. An infrastructure platform's revenue scales with the entire market. We still trade, but that's how we validate the product, not the business itself." },
  { cat: "Product & Vision", q: "Could this become a matching engine / exchange?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "That's the natural evolution. Stage one, we're a smart router — send orders to the best venue. Stage two, once we have enough two-sided flow, we start matching users internally before routing externally. That's a dark pool, and it's way better economics — 30 to 50 bps instead of 2 to 5 bps on routing. Stage three, we become a hybrid venue. We don't need to replace Kalshi, we just need to sit in front of it and capture the flow." },

  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  // TRACTION & PROGRESS
  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  { cat: "Traction", q: "What's your current traction?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "We haven't launched the platform publicly yet. We built the infrastructure for our own trading and are now packaging it as a product. What we've built: 37,000 market subscriptions ingested across Kalshi and Polymarket, months of historical candle and limit order book data, real-time data pipelines, weather ML models that beat market pricing, and a working execution layer we trade on daily. We're our own first and most demanding customer." },
  { cat: "Traction", q: "Do you have any revenue?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Yes, from trading profits on our own infrastructure. We're profitable. But that's not the business — it's proof the infrastructure works. Product revenue from data subscriptions and execution fees starts when we launch the API publicly, which we're targeting before May." },
  { cat: "Traction", q: "Do you have users?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "No external users yet. We're pre-launch on the platform. We had about 5,000 followers on our prediction market indices before pivoting. The plan is: ship the free API and Python SDK, do a Show HN, post on r/algotrading and prediction market communities, and get our first 10 to 50 users before the batch starts." },
  { cat: "Traction", q: "What have you built so far technically?", speaker: "Rob", hint: "A lot. Go-based WebSocket ingestion layer handling 37,000 markets in real time. Redis Streams for event processing. Supabase PostgreSQL database with months of historical data. Parquet export pipeline for limit order book snapshots. A worker on Fly.io doing market discovery, candle backfilling, and sports data ingestion from ESPN. Vojta's ML models for weather prediction. And execution logic that trades on Kalshi. The full pipeline from data to signal to trade." },

  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  // BUSINESS MODEL
  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  { cat: "Business Model", q: "How will you make money?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Three revenue lines. One: data subscriptions, free tier for real-time prices, paid tiers from $99 to $5K per month for historical data, LOB snapshots, and enriched source data. Two: execution fees, 2 to 5 basis points on every trade routed through us. Three: as we scale and start matching orders internally, we capture spread instead of just routing fees — that's 10x better economics. Plus our own trading profits fund operations without dilution." },
  { cat: "Business Model", q: "What's the revenue potential?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Prediction markets are about $10 to 12 billion in annual volume today, growing 10x year over year. If the market reaches $500 billion to $1 trillion, and we capture 3 to 5 percent as the infrastructure layer at venue-level economics of 30 basis points, that's $150 to $500 million per year in execution revenue alone. Add data subscriptions and enterprise contracts, we're looking at a billion-dollar revenue business. For reference, Coinbase does $3 billion on $300 billion in volume." },
  { cat: "Business Model", q: "Who is your target customer?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Solo quants, small trading teams of 1 to 5 people, crypto funds entering prediction markets as a new asset class, and fintech apps that want to embed prediction market data or trading. Not Jump or Citadel — they'll build their own. Our customer is the 10,000 people who wish they could be Jump but can't build the infra. Same market as Alpaca, which is worth $1.5 billion serving indie algo traders." },
  { cat: "Business Model", q: "What's your GTM strategy?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Classic developer platform playbook. Free to experiment, pay to make money. Step one: ship a free API and Python SDK, put a Kaggle dataset out there, do Show HN, hit Reddit and Twitter. Get 10 to 50 users building models on our data. Step two: they want historical depth for backtesting, that's the paywall. Step three: their model works, they want to go live, they execute through us. One click from backtest to production. We don't sell — the funnel sells itself." },
  { cat: "Business Model", q: "What's the free tier include?", speaker: "Rob", hint: "Real-time prices across all exchanges in a unified format. Market metadata, search, and filtering. Basic historical prices, last 30 days. And the source data pairing — weather forecasts matched to weather markets, ESPN scores matched to sports markets. The raw data is mostly public, but we've structured it together and made it queryable in one call. That's the hook." },

  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  // COMPETITION & MOAT
  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  { cat: "Competition & Moat", q: "Who are your competitors?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Dome was a YC F25 company doing unified PM APIs — acquired by Polymarket, now dead as independent product. The Clearing Company raised $15M — acquired by Coinbase. pmxt is open source with 700 stars but just an API wrapper, no data, no history, no execution. Oddpool is a consumer dashboard, not infrastructure. Nobody has historical LOB data, nobody pairs source data with market data, nobody offers backtesting plus execution as a full stack." },
  { cat: "Competition & Moat", q: "What's your moat?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Time and compounding data. We've been recording 37,000 markets, limit order book snapshots, and candle data for months. Nobody can go back in time and collect that. Every day the gap widens. On top of that, the pairing of source data to markets — matching the right weather station to the right Kalshi contract — took months of domain work. Any single piece is copyable. The combination isn't. Building all of it takes a year. We're already there." },
  { cat: "Competition & Moat", q: "People can code easily now. What stops someone from copying you?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "The code is the easy part. The hard parts are: historical data you can't recreate, cross-venue normalization across exchanges with completely different APIs and settlement rules, the source data pairing which is domain knowledge not code, and battle-tested execution with real money. Plus once quants build models on our data format and backtest on our infra, their whole pipeline assumes our schema. Switching costs are real. Same reason people don't leave AWS." },
  { cat: "Competition & Moat", q: "What if Kalshi or Polymarket builds this themselves?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Exchanges historically suck at developer tools. Kalshi just launched Builder Codes and dev grants — they want ecosystem tooling, not to build it themselves. Polymarket was just acquired by a company building plumbing for them. Being exchange-neutral is our advantage. No trader wants to be locked into one venue's tools. We aggregate across all of them." },

  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  // TEAM
  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  { cat: "Team", q: "Tell us about the team.", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Three founders, equal equity. I'm CEO — 4 years at Marinade Finance on Solana, grew it from zero to $1.5B TVL, led marketing and partnerships. Rob is CTO — also from Marinade, built the product, full-stack engineer. Vojta is our Head of Research — DPhil from Oxford in quantum algorithm theory, built all our ML models. Vojta and I have known each other for 20 years since high school. Rob and I worked together for 4 years at Marinade." },
  { cat: "Team", q: "What's the equity split?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Equal thirds. 33, 33, 33. Clean and simple. We had a different structure earlier when we were exploring different directions, but once we committed to building this together full-time, equal split was the obvious choice. It's locked in." },
  { cat: "Team", q: "Is Vojta fully committed?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Yes, full-time. He built our entire ML pipeline, the weather models, the sports data ingestion. He's our Chief Researcher and a third of this company. The platform doesn't depend on one person though — the data pipelines, execution layer, backtesting, that's company IP. Vojta built the first models, but the infrastructure keeps working regardless." },
  { cat: "Team", q: "What if Vojta wants to go trade on his own?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Then he'd be a customer of Attena. That's actually the point — our platform is so good that anyone, including our own team, would use it to build trading strategies. But right now, 100 percent of his time is Attena. Our head of research is so confident in the platform that eventually people will build funds on top of it." },
  { cat: "Team", q: "Why are you the right team for this?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "We've built real infrastructure at scale before. Marinade Finance processed billions in staking volume on Solana. We know crypto, we know data pipelines, and Vojta brings serious quant rigor from Oxford. We also trade on our own system daily, so we feel every bug and every improvement firsthand. We're not building something theoretical — we use it." },
  { cat: "Team", q: "How did you meet?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Vojta and I met in high school about 20 years ago — we built a mobile game together back then. Rob and I have known each other for 5 years and worked together at Marinade Finance for 4 of those, with Rob on product and me on marketing. I introduced them, and we started Attena together." },
  { cat: "Team", q: "Will you change the equity every time you change the idea?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "No. Last time the split reflected who built the models — it was structured around trading. When we committed to the infrastructure company, equal split made sense because we all bring equal but different value. Vu runs the business, Rob builds the platform, Vojta builds the models. The equity reflects the team, not the idea. It's final." },

  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  // THE PIVOT / YC HISTORY
  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  { cat: "Pivot & History", q: "You applied to YC as a prop trading firm. What changed?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "To be honest — last round we saw YC's RFS about AI-native hedge funds and pivoted our pitch toward prop trading over a weekend. The equity split followed from that framing. It was a mistake. The infrastructure is what we actually built, what we're excited about, and what we spend our time on every day. This pitch is closer to what we've always been building. Last time we tried to fit an RFS. This time we're just telling you what we're actually doing." },
  { cat: "Pivot & History", q: "Are you just tailoring your pitch for us?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "The irony is we tailored our pitch last time, for YC, toward prop trading. That was the performative version. The infra is what we actually built and what we work on every day. YC's feedback confirmed what we were already seeing — the infrastructure is the bigger business. We're not pivoting because someone told us to. We're finally pitching what we've been building all along." },
  { cat: "Pivot & History", q: "YC rejected you. Why?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Two reasons. One, our equity split in the interview didn't match our application — that was our mistake, we hadn't had the hard conversation yet. Two, they said prop trading is hard to venture-scale, and they were right. They told us the infrastructure was bigger. We agreed, not because they said it, but because we built it and saw it ourselves. They left the door open and said they'd be happy to hear from us again." },
  { cat: "Pivot & History", q: "What did you learn from the YC process?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Three things. Don't bend your pitch to fit what you think someone wants to hear. Have the hard conversations about equity before you're in a room being asked about it. And listen to feedback that confirms what you already suspect — we knew the infra was the bigger play, we just needed the push to commit to it." },

  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  // MARKET SIZE & TIMING
  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  { cat: "Market & Timing", q: "How big is the prediction market?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "About $10 to 12 billion in annual volume today. For context, sports betting was zero in the US in 2018, now it's $120 billion. Crypto spot was $100 billion in 2017, now $36 trillion. Prediction markets are following the same curve. Kalshi and Polymarket are both valued in the billions. Conservative estimate: $500 billion to $1 trillion within 5 to 7 years. Every binary outcome becomes tradable." },
  { cat: "Market & Timing", q: "Why now?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Three things converging. One: regulatory tailwinds — CFTC approved Kalshi for sports, more categories coming. Two: the 2024 election proved mainstream demand — Polymarket became a household name. Three: crypto infrastructure makes launching new markets trivial. The supply of markets is about to explode, and there's zero quant infrastructure for any of it. We're building it before the flood." },
  { cat: "Market & Timing", q: "What if prediction markets stay niche?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Even at $100 to 200 billion — which would be a disappointment — a 3 to 5 percent infrastructure share is still $30 to $100 million in revenue. That's a real business. But every signal points the other direction. The market doubled in the last year. Kalshi raised $300M. Sports betting legalization keeps expanding. We're betting on the category, and the downside is still a good business." },

  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  // CRYPTO / ONCHAIN SPECIFIC (for Alliance)
  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  { cat: "Crypto & Onchain", q: "Is there a token play here?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Potentially. If we become a matching engine, a protocol token for governance and fee sharing makes sense — similar to dYdX or Uniswap. Our data feeds could also become onchain oracles for DeFi protocols that want prediction market prices. But we're not leading with a token — we're leading with a product that works. The token economics come later when there's real volume to distribute." },
  { cat: "Crypto & Onchain", q: "How does this relate to DeFi?", speaker: "Rob", hint: "Polymarket already runs onchain. As more prediction markets go onchain, DeFi protocols will want to use prediction market prices as inputs — for structured products, hedging, insurance. We'd be the data layer that feeds those protocols. Think Chainlink for prediction markets. Our historical data and real-time feeds are exactly what a DeFi integration needs." },
  { cat: "Crypto & Onchain", q: "What blockchain experience does the team have?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Deep. Vu and Rob spent 4 years at Marinade Finance, the largest liquid staking protocol on Solana — we grew it from zero to $1.5 billion TVL. We've shipped onchain products, managed protocol upgrades, worked with validators and DeFi integrations. We know how to build in crypto. Attena's backend already integrates with Polymarket's onchain settlement." },

  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  // FUNDRAISING & TERMS
  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  { cat: "Fundraising", q: "What are you raising?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "$500K on a $5M post-money SAFE with a token side letter." },
  { cat: "Fundraising", q: "How will you use the funds?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Three things. One: ship the public API and SDK, get first users. Two: expand data coverage to more verticals and exchanges. Three: build out the execution layer from smart routing to internal matching. The money gives us 12 to 18 months of runway to get to product-market fit and early revenue." },
  { cat: "Fundraising", q: "What's your burn rate?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Low. Three founders, no office. Infrastructure costs are modest — Supabase, Fly.io, Redis. Trading profits partially offset operating costs. With $500K we have plenty of runway to reach revenue milestones." },

  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  // HARD QUESTIONS
  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  { cat: "Hard Questions", q: "You're pre-launch with no users. Why should we fund you?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Because we've built the hardest part. The data infrastructure, the ML pipeline, the execution layer — that's months of work that's already done and battle-tested with real money. Most pre-launch startups have a prototype. We have a production system that trades daily. Launching the API is packaging, not building from scratch. And we have months of historical data that nobody can replicate." },
  { cat: "Hard Questions", q: "What's the biggest risk?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Market size risk. If prediction markets don't grow beyond $50 billion, our ceiling is limited. But we hedge that by trading on our own infrastructure — we make money regardless of whether external users adopt. The product risk is low because the infrastructure already works. The team risk is low because we've worked together for years. The question is how big the category gets, and every signal says very big." },
  { cat: "Hard Questions", q: "Are you just going to trade and not build the product?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "We trade because it proves the product works, and it funds development without dilution. But the business is the platform. A trading firm's revenue is capped by capital. A platform's revenue scales with the market. We'd stop trading tomorrow if we had 10 paying API customers — the trading just proves nobody else has this data quality yet." },
  { cat: "Hard Questions", q: "What if you're actually a market maker, not a platform?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "We will do market making — matching orders internally is literally market making. But the difference is we don't pay for flow like Citadel does. Our data platform brings traders to us organically. That's a structural advantage no traditional market maker has. We're a data platform that monetizes through execution and matching, not a market maker that bolted on a data product." },
  { cat: "Hard Questions", q: "What keeps you up at night?", speaker: "Vu", hint: "Regulation. CFTC could clamp down instead of opening up. We mitigate by being infrastructure, not an exchange — we don't hold customer funds or operate a matching venue initially. But regulatory risk is real and we watch it closely." },
